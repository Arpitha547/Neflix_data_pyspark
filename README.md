# Neflix_data_pyspark
##Overview

This project demonstrates a data engineering solution for analyzing and organizing Netflix movie and show datasets. It is designed to provide insights into top-performing movies and shows, yearly trends, and detailed information about cast and crew. The project creates three tables to address specific use cases:

Best in Year Movies Table: Captures the best movie and the best movies genres for each year.
Best in Year Shows Table: Captures the best shows and the best shows genres for each year
Movies Table: Stores metadata for movies, including ratings, votes, genre, and a map of cast and crew (e.g., actors and directors).
Shows Table: Similar to the Movies Table but tailored for TV shows, including the number of seasons.

This repository showcases the code in pyspark, and data processing steps used to create these tables. The project is ideal for showcasing skills in data modeling, ETL, and analytics.
